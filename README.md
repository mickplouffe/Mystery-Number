# Mystery Number Game

Welcome to the Mystery Number Game repository! This project is a simple console-based game implemented in Java, where the objective is to guess a randomly selected number within a certain range. The game provides hints, indicating whether the guess is higher or lower than the mystery number, adding a fun and interactive element to the guessing process.


[Files will be uploaded in the future. This README is writen before hand.]

## Overview

The Mystery Number Game is designed to run in the terminal and offers a straightforward yet engaging gameplay experience. Upon starting the game, it randomly selects a number within a predefined range (e.g., 1 to 100). Players then attempt to guess the number, receiving feedback after each guess to help guide them towards the correct answer.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation**: The game starts by selecting a random number within a specified range, ensuring a unique experience each time.
- **Hint System**: After each guess, the game provides a hint, indicating whether the actual number is higher or lower than the guess.
- **Guess Counting**: Tracks the number of attempts taken to correctly guess the mystery number, allowing players to challenge themselves to improve.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Utilizes the console for easy gameplay interaction, with clear instructions and feedback provided to the user.
- **Customizable Range**: The range within which the mystery number is selected can be easily adjusted in the code, allowing for different levels of difficulty.

## Getting Started

Ensure Java is installed on your system to compile and run this game. First, clone this repository and navigate to the game's directory in your terminal. Compile the Java file using the following command:

```bash
javac MysteryNumberGame.java
```

After compilation, start the game by running:

```bash
java MysteryNumberGame
```

## How to Play

Once the game starts, you'll be prompted to enter your guess for the mystery number. After each guess, you'll receive a hint indicating whether the actual number is higher or lower than your guess. Use these hints to make your next guess more informed. The game continues until you correctly guess the mystery number, at which point it will reveal how many attempts you took.
