# Mystery Number Game

Welcome to the Mystery Number Game repository! This project is a simple console-based game implemented in Java, where the player guess a randomly selected number within a certain range. The game offers multiple difficulty levels and provides hints, indicating whether the guess is higher or lower than the mystery number.

## Overview

The Mystery Number Game is designed to run in the terminal and offers a straightforward yet engaging gameplay experience. It features a menu system that allows players to select from three difficulty levels: easy (1-10), normal (1-100), and hard (1-1000). Each level randomly selects a number within its range, and players attempt to guess the number, receiving feedback after each guess to guide them towards the correct answer.

## Features

- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Choose from easy, normal, or hard mode, with the mystery number's range adjusting accordingly.
- **Random Number Generation**: The game selects a random number within the specified range for each game, ensuring a unique experience each time.
- **Hint System**: Provides hints after each guess, indicating whether the actual number is higher or lower.
- **Replayability**: Offers the option to play again after each game.

## Getting Started

Ensure Java is installed on your system to compile and run this game. First, clone this repository and navigate to the game's directory in your terminal. Compile the Java file using the following command:

```bash
javac Main.java
```

After compilation, start the game by running:

```bash
java Main
```

## How to Play

After launching the game, you'll be presented with a menu to choose the difficulty level. Once you start a game, you'll be prompted to enter your guess for the mystery number. After each guess, you'll receive a hint indicating whether the actual number is higher or lower than your guess. Use these hints to make your next guess more informed. The game continues until you correctly guess the mystery number. You'll then have the option to play again or exit.
